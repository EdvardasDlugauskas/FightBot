# Quick Guide
The main file is `maxbot2.py` - it is the bot with which I participated in the contest and got the second place in the contest.

It works by performing a statistical analysis on the moves of the opponent. The bot analyzes the enemy's patterns and picks one move with a weighted choice. This ensures that the moves are more or less random and on point.

Most other files are bots created by me as my previous contestants and were used to train the final bot. You might find them useful.
